holiday during the year. This class has three instance variables:
name, which is a String representing the name of the holiday
day, which is an int representing the day of the month of the holiday
month, which is a String representing the month the holiday is in
a) Write a constructor for the class Holiday, which takes a Stringrepresenting the name, an
int representing the day, and a String representing the month as its arguments, and sets the
class variables to these values.
b) Write a method inSameMonth, which compares two instances of the class Holiday,and
returns the Boolean value trueif they have the same month, and falseif they do not.
c) Write a piece of code that creates a Holidayinstance with the name “Independence Day”,
with the day “4”, and with the month “July”.

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title of the
movie, a Stringrepresenting the studio, and a Stringrepresenting the rating as its
arguments, and sets the respective class variables to these values.
b) Write a second constructor for the class Movie, which takes a Stringrepresenting the title
of the movie and a Stringrepresenting the studio as its arguments, and sets the respective

92. Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store.
An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables‐a part number(type String),a part
description(type String),a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item  (double). Your
class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables.Provide a method named getInvoice Amount that calculates the invoice
amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as a double value. If the
quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0.
